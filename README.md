# KnapSack-Ruby

##### Description

###### Given a list of items with corresponding weights and values, find the best possible permutation of items to put in the Knap Sack that produces the highest sum of value without exceeding the Knap Sack's weight capacity.

##### Ex.

###### Per the below, the best possible permutation of items to put in the Knap Sack that will give us the highest value are items _1,3,4,_ and _6_. Their weights sum up to _9 lbs_, so it does not exceed the Knap Sack's weight capacity of 10 _lbs_. And their values sum up to _14_. 

```   
Item  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Weight[3, 9, 2, 1, 7, 3, 11]
Value [5, 7, 4, 3, 5, 2, 30]

Capacity = 10 lbs.

>>> 14
```
